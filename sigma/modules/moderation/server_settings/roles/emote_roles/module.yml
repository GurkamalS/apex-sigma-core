      Creates a role group for binding emote role to.
      Emote roles need to be limited to groups due to generating
      emote toggle messages for said roles which have limited emote numbers.
      As a good side effect, this also allows placing multiple emote toggle messages
      in different places with slight alterations.

      You enter the ID of the emote role group you want to make a toggler for
      and can also specify the channel you want it to go. If no channel is specified
      the toggler is created in the current channel. The toggler message contains
      instruction on how to use the toggles. You can add "nodesc" to the end of the command
      if you don't want the toggle instructions to be displayed in the toggler message.
