      Toggles the anticaps limiter.
      The default is a minimum of 5 capital letters and 60% of the message being caps.
      This can be controlled with the "capslimit" and "capspercentage" commands.

  - name:         capslimit
    enabled:      true
    usage:        "{pfx}{cmd} 9"
    description:
      Sets the minimum number of capital letters in a message to check for before
      a message is checked for what percentage of the message is in caps.

  - name:         capspercentage
    alts:
      - "capspercent"
    enabled:      true
    usage:        "{pfx}{cmd} 80"
    description:
      Sets the minimum percentage of the message's capital letters.
      If this percentage is crossed, the message is deleted.
      Basically if 80% of the message is caps (as set in the usage example), it'll get nuked.

      Toggles the antispam limiter.
      This basically enforces a custom rate limited upon users.
      The default is 5 messages per 5 seconds.

  - name:         ratelimit
    enabled:      true
    usage:        "{pfx}{cmd} 6/10"
    description:
      Sets the message amount and timespan for the rate limit.
      Separated by a slash, the amount goes first and timespan second.
      The usage example translates to a limit of 6 messages per 10 seconds.
      Any messages that cross it get nuked.
