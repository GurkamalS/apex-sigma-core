description:
  The Avolakia looks like the worst bits of an octopus, a worm and an insect combined.
  Preferring to feast on the flesh of the undead, they maintain herds of zombies deep underground.
  Their shape shifting abilities mean they can be found infiltrating settlements to further their own ends.
