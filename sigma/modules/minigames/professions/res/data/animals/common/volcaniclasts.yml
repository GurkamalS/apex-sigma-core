description:
  Volcaniclasts, elemental beings born from a release of energy and sent hurtling over the land.
  Wherever they land (often a violent affair) they incubate for some time before awakening and spreading fire through the land.
  Some have been known to lay dormant for decades, even centuries until the conditions are right.
  Then they unleash their destruction upon the world around them.
