description:
  Dawshets once roamed all over the material plane before they were hunted down and sold for their prescious armored hide.
  Now only a handful of these creatures exist in the most exotic of places.
  These creatures are packed with defensive traits such as the ability to heat up their mucus and exhale it through their upper most horns,
  their extremely thick hides, and their razor sharp scales protruding from their back.
