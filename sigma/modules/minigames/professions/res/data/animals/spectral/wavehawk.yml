description:
  The Wavehawk is a teal-coloured seabird with a collar of opalescent downy feathers.
  Their feathers are coated in a thin oily layer which makes them resilient to both rain and seawater.
  A wavehawks diet consists exclusively of fish and crustaceans, which it will dive into the sea to retrieve.
  A wavehawk can breathe water as well as air, though since there are less natural predators in the skies, the wavehawk spends more time in flight than swimming
