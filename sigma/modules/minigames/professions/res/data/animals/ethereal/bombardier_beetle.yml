description:
  The Bombardier Beetle is a carnivorous insect, black and red or orange in colour.
  It can be found in grassy or wooded areas. The beetle lays its eggs in warm, moist places and the larvae, once hatched, are also carnivorous.
  The beetle is so named because it can shoot a foul-smelling, caustic liquid at near boiling temeperature from its abdomen.
  This liquid is deadly to other insects, and an effective deterent and irritant to other potential threats.
