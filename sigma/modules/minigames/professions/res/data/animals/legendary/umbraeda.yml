description:
  These beings of pure shadow streak through the darkness with unnatural speed, shying away from the light as they kill, feast, and twist their slain into more and more Umbraeda.
  Fearing the innocent- primarily children and the devout- Umbraedas drag their prey into the darkness.
  They prefer one on one combat, using their manipulation of the shadows to create temporary pocket dimensions to trap their foes in.
