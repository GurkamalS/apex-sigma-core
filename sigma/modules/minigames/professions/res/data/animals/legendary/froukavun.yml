description:
  Froukavun are an Orc-like race of elementals that dwell on the border between the plane of Water and the plane of Ice.
  Their bodies are composed of ice and flesh, their skin is a dull gray, dusted with frost.
  Parts of their bodies are pure ice, which grows as they age, the older the Froukavun is, the more ice covers its body.
  Because of their icy body, they are inherently slower as they age. However, if their bodies are relieved of ice, they gain more freedom of movement.
