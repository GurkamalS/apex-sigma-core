description:
  A necrotic pustule is created when a creature is killed by weak necrotic magic. 
  The body of the creature peels and decays away leaving nothing but the cyst, given some semblence of sentience and engorged by the lifeforce of its host.
  The pustule will aimlessly wander leaving a trail of decayed flora in its wake.
  It will continue to do this until it is harvested or mistaken for food by an unfortunate scavenger.
