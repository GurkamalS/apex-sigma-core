description:
  Spikers are large, landbound sea urchins that live on coasts wrought by storms.
  They move by thrusting their spikes into to ground and tensing, pushing themselves forward.
  Their spikes can extend to piercing anything that comes close.
  In addition, to extending, the spines can be launched to pin down foes that try to escape.
  Often traveling in packs of 5-10, spikers swarm and puncture any prey they can find, finding sustenance by slurping up the blood and bile of their prey.
