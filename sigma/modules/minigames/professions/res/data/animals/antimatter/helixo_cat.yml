description:
  With three eyes and the ability to hypnotize anyone who gazes into them, the Helixo Cat is elusive and very hard to capture.
  They are highly desired by those with the wealth to afford one, being among the most expensive animals to purchase and maintain.
  It has a luxurious tail and the softest fur of any animal. Be wary though, those who fall victim to its hypnosis are said to be that way forever!
