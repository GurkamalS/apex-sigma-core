description:
  Bog Creepers are an amalgamation of natural oil, earth and the waters of the swamp given life.
  Their homes are often thick, fetid and boggy waters, almost tar like in consistency.
  They care only for their domains and protect their homes fervently.
  Typically Bog Creepers are large, roughly humanoid in shape and their translucent bodies belie the plant life and detritus inside, which slowly shifts as it moves.
