description:
  Smaller than the average griffon, these scavengers have the thick torsos and hindlegs of hyenas and the lanky head, forelegs, and wings of turkey vultures.
  They are typically found scouring blackened wastelands and scorching deserts for their next meal, though they can also be found in certain urban environments, given the right conditions.
