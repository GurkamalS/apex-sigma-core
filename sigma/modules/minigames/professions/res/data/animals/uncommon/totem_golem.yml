description:
  Carved from wood and bone by tribal societies and druidic circles, Totem Golems serve as guardians to sacred sites and ancient temples.
  Sculpted and painted in beautiful detail, this golem is adorned with the visages of the spirits worshiped by its creators.
  Bound within these constructs are small fragments of the great spirits.
  They give it life and direction, but not intelligence. Often they are found standing sentry in sacred burial sites or at the borders of a tribe's territory.
