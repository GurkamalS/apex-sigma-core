description:
  A Greblin could be mistaken for a Goblin at a casual glance, but closer inspection reveals their mottled skin is actually a series of complicated runic designs;
  Upon close inspection the runes are found to relate to spells such as dispel magic, counterspell and detect magic.
  They are also more feral than goblins, usually found hunched over on all fours, and whilst intelligent and capable of speech they prefer to growl, grunt and snarl.
  It isn't unheard of however for a greblin to disguise itself as a goblin and attempt to blend into goblinoid society.
