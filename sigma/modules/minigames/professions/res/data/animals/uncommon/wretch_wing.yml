description:
  Giant bats are often found in deep, fey woods, but only rarely does word of a Wretch-Wing reach the ears of monster hunters.
  A wingspan reaching up to 20 feet, silent as the night, and voracious in their hunger, wretch-wings glide through the darkened skies searching for prey.
  A single wretch-wing can decimate the livelihood of small towns and villages in a matter of weeks, its appetite for fresh kills being insatiable.
  Should a mated pair make roost near any settlement, they are quick to hire a hunter to drive them off.
