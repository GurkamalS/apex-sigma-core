description:
  The Guardian Day Gecko looks very similar to its more widespread and wellknown cousin, the giant day gecko, save for the twin horns atop its head and its abnormally large size.
  These creatures roam only the most remote jungles, and are sometimes ridden by sprites as mounts.
  In times of danger, the guardian day gecko will emit a bright flash of light from the red spots that stripe or spot its back.
  This flash is so bright, it can temporarily blind creatures which are not accustomed to light.
