description:
  A twisted little head on a spring, with an equally twisted and wicked sense of humour, Jack is as slippery as they come, able to dart in and out of containers almost too fast to keep track of.
  He reads the minds of those nearby and uses their fears and worries against them.
  He takes great delight in everything he does, and will likely spend most of the encounter when he's not hurling insults around, laughing and singing and just being generally, well, creepy.
