description:
  With no eyes, nose, or ears, this infernal creature relies upon an incredibly sensitive capacity to detect minute changes in its surroundings through taste.
  The chemical receptors on the Famine Demon's tongue can track not only movement, but also monitor the emotional state of its prey.
  By detecting slight changes in a target's emotions, the Famine Demon can anticipate their actions.
  For example, a sudden increase in anger usually precedes an attack, and allows the Demon to dodge out of the way preemptively.
