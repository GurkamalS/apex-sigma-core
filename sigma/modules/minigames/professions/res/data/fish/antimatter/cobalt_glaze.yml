description:
  A very dark color fish, in fact, you only see a shadow swimming in the waters.
  These fish were poached near extinction as their scales were used for pigments in the past.
  Thanks to the development of synthetic pigments, they are slowly climbing in numbers but are hard to catch thanks to natural selection.
