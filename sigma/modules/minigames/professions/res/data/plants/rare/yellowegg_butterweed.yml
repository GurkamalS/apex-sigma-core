description:
  This plant was originally awarded this strange name because its flower looks like an egg yolk.
  However, according to ancient myths,
  it began its life as a yellow dragon that transformed and sadly choked
  on a fried egg. A little out there we agree,
  but an interesting backstory nonetheless.
