description:
  Tropical pitcher plants, also called Monkey Cups by those familiar with the species.
  These fanciful flowers look like you can walk up and take a drink right from them,
  but that’s the last thing you’ll want to do.
  In fact, the Tropical Pitcher Plants are carnivorous climbers,
  luring in unsuspecting insects with sweet nectar that are then trapped
  in the goblet-like cup and unable to escape.
  Tropical Pitcher Plants have been surprising people since the 1800s,
  but not many realise that the Pitcher Plant isn’t a flower at all—the
  pitchers are modified leaves!
