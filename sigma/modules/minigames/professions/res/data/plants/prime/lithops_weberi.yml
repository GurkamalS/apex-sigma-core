description:
  You may have heard of a pet stone before, but a flowering stone?
  Nope, your eyes aren’t playing tricks on you, it’s Lithops Weberi,
  otherwise known as Living Stones.
  These awesome little succulents are perfect to grow indoors,
  especially for folks whose thumbs are not so green. When Lithops bloom,
  it looks extraordinary, with a white or yellow daisy poking out from what appears to be solid stone.
  Talk about easy to propagate! If you want to multiply your Living Stones,
  simply take a leaf off of one, stick it into the pebble bed and it will take root.
