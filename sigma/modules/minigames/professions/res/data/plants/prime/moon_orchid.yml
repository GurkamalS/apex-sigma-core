description:
  Usually, in nature, the stripings and markings on flowers are evolved
  to either mimic larger animals in order to scare away predators,
  in this case, the Moon Orchidâ€™s stripes look almost exactly like that of a tiger!
  Makes you wonder what kind animals this lovely little flower is trying to scare off.
