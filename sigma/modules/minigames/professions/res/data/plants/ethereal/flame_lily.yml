  One of nature’s true exquisite beauties is the Flame Lily.
  This perennial plant is both a climber and scrambler and adds intrigue wherever it grows.
  Like nearly all lilies,
  the Flame Lily is considered poisonous to humans and animals (especially cats!),
  so if you insist on growing it make sure to take proper precautions.
  A fun fact about the Flame Lily is that it’s actually considered a weed that
  thrives naturally in sandy coastal conditions.
  That’s one weed we wouldn’t mind having in our backyard.
