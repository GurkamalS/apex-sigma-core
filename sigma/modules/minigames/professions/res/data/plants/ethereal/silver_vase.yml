description:
  Even those with without green thumbs should be able to grow the Silver Vase plant.
  The Silver Vase is a slow grower with broad, waxy leaves and sharp, spiky flower heads.
  Once the pink flower has finished blooming, the silvery striped leaves will begin to die.
  However, after the flowering period is over there will be offshoots,
  called pups, produced towards the base of the plant that you can transplant and propagate.
