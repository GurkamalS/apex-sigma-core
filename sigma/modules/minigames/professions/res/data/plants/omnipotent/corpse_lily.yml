description:
  It blooms so infrequently that whenever one does,
  it often makes local and sometimes global headlines.
  The Corpse Lily is technically a compound flower,
  not only is this flower extremely rare, it’s extremely large,
  some can grow up to 12 feet tall and weigh nearly 200 pounds!
  If you’re still curious as to where it got its name,
  just take a whiff of one. The flower gives off the putrid odour
  of a rotting body in order to attract insects for pollination.
