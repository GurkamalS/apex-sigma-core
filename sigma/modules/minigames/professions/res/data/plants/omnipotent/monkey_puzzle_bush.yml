description:
  An Englishman in the early 1800s said that the bush,
  possibly climbing up to 150 feet tall and almost being classed as a tree,
  would be a puzzle for a monkey to climb due to the bushes branches being wavy
  and pointing in awkward directions,
  even though there are no monkeys where this tree grows!
