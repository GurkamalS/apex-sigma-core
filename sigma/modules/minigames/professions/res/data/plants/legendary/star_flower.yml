description:
  Perhaps more appropriately called the starfish flower,
  the Star Flower is another carrion plant,
  a plant that mimics the smell of dead flesh,
  sought by plant collectors and gardeners because of its unique,
  striking appearance and large fuzzy flowers,
  this is a plant that is best kept outside.
  The colour of this plant’s flowers can range from deep
  reds and purples to lighter pinks, mauves, and yellow.
  It’s touchable, hairy, leathery flower may draw you in but it’s
  disgusting scent will send you running for the hills. Why?
  Because the Star Flower’s pollinator of choice is the fly,
  and what better to lure flies than the sweet, sweet smell of rotting meat!
