description:
  Despite its strange appearance, or perhaps because of,
  the Spider Mums is a favourite flower of florists and gardeners alike.
  Like all other mums, the Spider Mum is well-suited for patio or container gardening.
  To keep your Spider Mums blooming for as long as you can,
  be sure to remove faded blooms and tightly closed buds
  (instead of the larger flowers) to encourage new flowering.
