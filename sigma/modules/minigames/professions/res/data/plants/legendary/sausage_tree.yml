description:
  No, those aren’t brats hanging off of this tree — they’re actually fruit!
  The sausage tree’s fruit is highly poisonous when eaten raw, but is fermented,
  dried or roasted to be consumable. Be careful if you ever come across one of
  these trees — the fruit, which can weigh over 20 pounds,
  can really hurt someone if it falls!
