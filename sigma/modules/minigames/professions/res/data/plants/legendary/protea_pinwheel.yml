description:
  This fun flower looks more like a carnival toy than a creation of nature.
  The coolest fact about this flower is that itâ€™s interconnected with fire.
  In the wild, Protea Pinwheels are perfectly suited to adapt to harsh climates.
  The best time for Protea Pinwheels to bloom is after a fire,
  when the adult plants, rodents,
  and other insects that would impede their growth have been destroyed.
  Protea Pinwheels ensure their continued existence by producing little
  fruit that is collected and eaten by ants. The ants do not eat the seeds,
  which remain dormant underground until there is a fire at which time the
  seeds are cued to begin germination.
