description:
  This happy little guy gets its name from its uncanny resemblance to a smiling bumblebee,
  that is if bumblebees could smile.
  The Bee Orchid requires a symbiotic relationship with a particular
  type of fungus to successfully grow, making transplanting tough.
  This orchid is more clever than it appears; the flowers are almost exclusively
  self-pollinating, but the colouring and shape of the flower mimic the look
  and smell of a female bee which entices male bees towards it to mate,
  thus expediting the pollination process!
