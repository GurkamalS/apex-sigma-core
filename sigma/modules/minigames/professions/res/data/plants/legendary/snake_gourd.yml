description:
  The beautiful Snake Gourd flower may look like it belongs on a festively wrapped present,
  but it’s actually a vegetable! It’s a member of the pumpkin family,
  like all gourds, and shares similarities with the bitter melon plant,
  as the long vegetables, it produces taste quite sour and bitter.
  Despite its terrible taste, the fruit from the Snake Gourd flower is used in
  a variety of different medical applications, and the reddish fruit inside an
  overly-ripe gourd can also be used as a tomato substitute when cooking.
