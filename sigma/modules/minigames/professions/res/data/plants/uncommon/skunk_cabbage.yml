description:
  The Skunk Cabbage is a huge, foul smelling plant thatâ€™s found in North America.
  Often found in swamps, its odour is often mistaken for a skunk, hence the name.
  Its appearance is also something to behold, with golden or purple leaves.
  While certain parts of the plant were found to be edible by Native Americans,
  death can be caused from severe calcium oxalate poisoning if the wrong part is eaten.
