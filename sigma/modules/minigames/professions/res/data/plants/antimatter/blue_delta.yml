  With dark blue leaves with a white outline this plant is a symbol of wealth.
  It is rare, hard to cultivate, and very small. Meaning only the richest few can indulge in it.
  Crushed into a fine powder and added to a classy drink, it invokes a feeling of hazyness.
  Some quite enjoy the unusual sensations this plant produces.
