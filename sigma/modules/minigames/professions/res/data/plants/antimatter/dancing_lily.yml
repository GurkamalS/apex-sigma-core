description:
  These little beauties are one of the rarest flowers around and prove quite hard to find,
  Nicknamed for their resemblance to dancing ladies in dresses.
  Dancing Girls trail and climb, so they make lovely additions to
  hanging planters where you can enjoy their fabulous flowers at eye-level.
  Dancing Girls will root wherever they touch the soil,
  and they make excellent indoor plants if you can find one.
