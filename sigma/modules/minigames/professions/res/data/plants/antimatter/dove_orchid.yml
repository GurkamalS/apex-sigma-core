description:
  The Dove Orchid produces delicately marbled white flowers that,
  if you look closely, look like they have a small dove with open wings perched inside.
  While most orchids can be found growing on or near trees,
  this type of orchid differentiates itself by growing on ground level,
  sometimes on rocks. The dove inside the flower is so intricate
  it looks almost like itâ€™s been carved out of ivory.
