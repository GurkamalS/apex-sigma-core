  If you’ve ever had any doubt as to whether or not a flower is a living creature,
  here’s the proof! Many gardeners and horticulturists are fond of Snapdragons
  for their bright colors and fragrance—not to mention if you squeeze the sides
  of a snapdragon flower it looks like a dragon’s mouth opening and closing,
  Interestingly enough, in ancient times, people believed Snapdragons held mystical powers,
  and that growing them in one’s garden would protect one’s home from curses and evil
