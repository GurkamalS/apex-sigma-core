description:
  At first glance, it looks like this little plant’s got a fungus on its flowers,
  but that’s actually the way it is supposed to look.
  How can a succulent plant that hasn’t changed for thousands of years
  continue to survive in one of the driest places in the world?
  It gets all of its moisture from fog and dew, that’s how.
