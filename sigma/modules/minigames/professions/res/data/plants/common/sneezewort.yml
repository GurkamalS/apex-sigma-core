description:
  This plant originally got this name because it was used as sneezing powder.
  The flower would be dried up and used to help clear out people’s sinuses by making them sneeze.
  Clearly, times have changed a little.
  Interestingly, these plants can be used for more than just sneezing – they can also be eaten in salads and used as insect repellents.
  Multifunctional!
