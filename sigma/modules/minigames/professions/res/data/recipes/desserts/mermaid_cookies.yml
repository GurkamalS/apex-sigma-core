description:
  After carefully combining these ingredients and baking them for 18 minutes,
  these cookies give off the sweet aroma of flowers.
  If baked properly, they will come out of the oven sparkling with a shimmer
  of what looks similar to green and blue glitter.
  Eating exactly 3 cookies will make it so you can breathe under water for 1 hour.
