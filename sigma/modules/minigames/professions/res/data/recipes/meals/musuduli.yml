description:
  Musuduli is a dish of a quality Doufon breast wrapped in
  Invernal strips and seasoned with Ravatust that's been dried and aged.
  The Doufon is usually prepared on a spitroast with Ravatust mixed with olive oild
  frequently dabbed on it to keep it nice and juicy and let the meat soak it in.
  While the Invernal is flayed and grilled until light blue.
  For garnish we suggest basil leaves and lemon slices.
